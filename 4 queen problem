This is a specific instance of the more general N-Queens problem
steps -
Step 1: Understand the Problem
Imagine a 4x4 chessboard.
step 2:You need to place 4 queens on this board.
But there's a rule: No two queens can attack each other.
This means:
step 3:No two queens can be in the same row (horizontal line).
step 4:No two queens can be in the same column (vertical line).
step 5:two queens can be on the same diagonal (slanted line).
step 6:Start placing queens one by one.

step 7:Place the first queen in the first row.
step 8:Move to the next row to place the second queen.
step 9:placing a queen, check if it is safe:

step 10:Is there already a queen in the same row?
step 11:Is there a queen in the same column?
step 12:Is there a queen on any diagonal?
step 13:If it's safe, place the queen. If not, try a different position.

step 14:If no position works, go back and move the previous queen to a new position.

Repeat until all queens are placed successfully.
